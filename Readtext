Set Up Database
Use MySQL to set up the required database and tables. Create a database called employee_management (or name it anything you prefer) and execute the following SQL:

sql
Copy code
CREATE DATABASE employee_management;
USE employee_management;

CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    phone VARCHAR(20),
    gender VARCHAR(10),
    dob DATE,
    address TEXT,
    position VARCHAR(50),
    department VARCHAR(50),
    date_of_joining DATE,
    salary DECIMAL(10, 2),
    employee_type VARCHAR(50),
    work_location VARCHAR(100),
    skill TEXT,
    status VARCHAR(20),
    profile_image VARCHAR(255)
);
Configure Database Connection
Update the db.php file in the config/ directory to match your local database credentials:

php
Copy code
<?php
$host = 'localhost';   // Hostname, default is localhost
$user = 'root';        // Username for MySQL
$password = '';        // Your MySQL password
$database = 'employee_management'; // Database name

// Create connection
$conn = new mysqli($host, $user, $password, $database);

// Check connection
if ($conn->connect_error) {
    die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
}
?>
Start the Server
If you are using XAMPP/WAMP, you can start Apache and MySQL, then navigate to http://localhost/employee_management/ in your browser.

Database Setup
You need a table to store employee details. The project assumes that you've set up a MySQL database as specified in the installation steps.

SQL Schema
You can find the schema within the employee_management.sql file, which creates the necessary table (employees). Import it into your MySQL database to use the project effectively.

Usage
1. Access Employee List
Go to the index.php page to see the employee list.
You can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) actions on the employee data from this page.
2. Add New Employee
Navigate to create.php to add a new employee. The form requires the employee's first name, last name, email, and additional details.
3. Search Employees
The search functionality allows searching by first name and last name. Enter a part of the name, and the system will auto-suggest employees from the list.
4. View Employee Details
Click on "Read More" under any employee's name to see detailed information about the employee.
5. Edit Employee Information
Edit employee details by clicking the "Edit" button in the actions column.
6. Delete Employee
Click on the "Delete" button to remove an employee record. Deletion is irreversible, so use with caution.
